Hi,

Regarding the CORS issue I am facing,after doing some debugging and research the issue seems to be with the rest response (security rules that are applied
to the server on which the rest services are hosted) to resolve this issue some security changes are required on rest server side.These are the options we 
have to solve the issue 
Option1
	Adding the required headers in response for each web service(tedious process)
		response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST, GET, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, HEAD");
        response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-PINGOTHER, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
        response.addHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "1728000");
Option2
	Implementing an CrossFilter by implementing javax.servlet.Filter and add above mentioned headers to every response  
	
	
Please correct me if I am missing something.
