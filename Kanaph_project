	In my current project at CITI Group I made two suggestions
1)To use AES/CBC/PKCS12 algorithm of BouncyCastle Service Provider to Encrypt the sensitive data that is being stored in the data base.
	Previously the sensitive data like SSN Number, Credit Cars Info is encrypted in such a way that a hacker can make a pattern matching out of the encrypted data. For example, when we encrypt “Apple” with our old implementation we always used to get “Orange” as encrypted string which would be a potential serious-security issue for pattern matching. With my suggestion by using BouncyCastle’s AES/CBC/PKCS12 algorithm we will get different encrypted strings every time. For example, if you encrypt “Apple” first time we will get “Pine”, second time we will get “Banana” and so on…which makes it more secured way of encrypting data and also since it’s a open source reduces the cost we are currently paying for RSA service provider. This Suggestion won best Idea of Quarter award. This made to production and all encryption mechanisms was refactored to use Bouncy Castle which I would feel as a good achievement.
 
2)To use Spring -Data-JPA instead of Hibernate.
	I worked on a different project an internal to our department (mortgage) which uses JDBC methods to interact with the database to retrieve data. We have a plan to move all the data from MYSQL to NO-SQL data base at later point of time. The project is to change the Data Access layer and use ORM/JPA framework to interact with the database. I suggested to use Spring Data JPA instead of Hibernate which can be well gelled with both relational and No-SQL databases. Keeping in mind that we would move to No-SQL database in near feature I suggested Spring-Data-JPA over hibernate. I got some good accolades for this idea and I implemented this this feature. Currently my code is in production and is working fine.
